Gdx-ai-demo

Just a desprate attempt to run gdx-ai-test, you can clone this repository and run 

gradle desktop:run 

Modify build.gradle in desktop folder to run different test, uncomment the test to run it.

I have taken these test from the main gdx-ai repository. Have a look at their main repository "gdx-ai"

https://github.com/libgdx/gdx-ai.git

Could be very useful to see running demos, without wasting time on trying to figure out, how to run it.
